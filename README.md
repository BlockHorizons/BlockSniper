### What is this?
BlockSniper is an advanced world editing tool, based on the idea of VoxelSniper from Mineraft PC softwares.
BlockSniper allows you to edit your world on a long range, with several different types and shapes. Shapes are the shapes types are being executed in. This means that every type can be executed in any shape.
**For more information, make sure to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sandertv/BlockSniper/wiki).**

### Translation
BlockSniper has a multi-language system, so everybody can have a good time using the plugin. We currently have nowhere near enough translated languages though, and we need your help! It is very appreciated if you help translate, so please do so whenever you have time. The available languages can be found under resources/languages.

### How does it work?
BlockSniper has several commands to edit your world. The commands can be found on the Wiki page [here](https://github.com/Sandertv/BlockSniper/wiki/Commands).


### Are there permissions? Where can I find them?
A full list of permissions can be found in the [plugin.yml](https://github.com/Sandertv/BlockSniper/blob/master/plugin.yml) file. 
It contains the most up to date permissions, so every permission available can be found there.

### I love/hate BlockSniper! Where can I review this?
BlockSniper can be reviewed at the poggit release page [here](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/BlockSniper/).
Any feedback given is very welcome, and it would be very much appreciated!
