An innovative brush world editing tool for PocketMine-MP: A Minecraft server software written in PHP.

---

### Overview
BlockSniper is an advanced world editing tool, based on the idea of VoxelSniper from Minecraft PC software.
BlockSniper allows you to edit your world from a long distance, with several different types and shapes. Shapes are the shapes types are being executed in. This means that every type can be executed in any shape.
A shape would, for example, be a sphere, a type replace. Every block in that shape will then get modified using the selected type; Replaced.
<br><br>
Almost all features can be managed using an in-game user interface. The brush menu can be opened using the /brush command.
<br><br>
Apart from just brushing, BlockSniper also features things such as copying and pasting (including schematics), undo and redo, presets and an extensive API for other plugins to build on.

Alternatively, BlockSniper may be downloaded by using:

BlockSniper can _not_ be downloaded by downloading the ZIP file GitHub provides. The required dependencies will not be installed if this is done.

### Translation
BlockSniper has a multi-language system, so everybody can have a good time using the plugin. We currently have nowhere near enough translated languages though, and we need your help! It is very appreciated if you help translate, so please do so whenever you have time. The available languages can be found under resources/languages.

### Permissions
A full list of permissions can be found in the [plugin.yml](https://github.com/BlockHorizons/BlockSniper/blob/master/plugin.yml) file. 
It contains the most up to date permissions, so every permission available can be found there.
Some permissions are also registered dynamically. The permissions of shapes consist out of: `blocksniper.shape.<lowercase shapename>`, whereas the permissions of types consist out of `blocksniper.type.<lowercase typename>`.

### Reviews
BlockSniper can be reviewed at the Poggit release page [here](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/BlockSniper/).
