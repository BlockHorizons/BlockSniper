# Translation information

Thank you for your interest in helping translate. Many currently existing languages are incomplete, so if your language is already here, do check if it is complete.
For an example on how to translate a new language, click the English translation. The English messages are the ones to be translated, so you can copy and translate those.

Please make sure to end every line with a full stop (.), wherever this is the case in the English translation, and if not, don't. 
Please name the file according to the ISO 639-1 codes, which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

### Thank you!
